# JS Execution

## Variable read and write

When enabled sandbox, the reading and writing of the Window attribute will be limited to the sandbox without escaping, including the following operations:

```ts
window.foo = 1;
window["foo"] = 1;
Reflect.defineProperty(window, "foo", {
  value: 1,
});
delete window.foo;
Reflect.deleteProperty(window, "foo");
```

Note that the success of the read and write operation is also affected by the attributes of the original variable, for example, there is a _non-writable_ attribute foo on the window, then the sandbox assignment will also fail:

```ts
window.foo = "new value"; // ‚ùå
```

In addition to window, Haploid.js also **protects reading and writing to the document attribute**, although this is rarely needed.

::: warning
Reads and writes to global variables other than window document are not sandboxed, such as **navigator.c=1**.

## Escape of variable

You may want to use the `escapeVariables` option to read and write the actual window and document versions in Haploid.js:

```ts{6}
container.registerApp({
  name: "foo",
  entry: "https://foo.com/entry",
  activeWhen: "/foo",
  sandbox: {
    escapeVariables: ["__GLOBAL_BASE"],
  },
});
```

However, one risk to pay special attention to is that once a global variable is redefined, it is likely to cause previously readable variables to become unreadable.

```ts
window.foo; // ok
// other program defines foo to unreadable
window.foo; // throw error
```

## Global Variables

In general, for reading and writing _window.foo_, we can omit the context prefix and simply write _foo_ instead of the usual one. This is how we use document, history and navigaor.

In a sandbox environment, except self, top, parent, globalThis, document, location, addEventListener, removeEventListener, dispatchEvent, eval, isFinite, isNaN, parseFloat, parseInt, hasOwnProperty, decodeURI, decodeURIComponent, encodeURI, encodeURIComponent and so on in **envVariables**, none of the variables declared in the option should be used this way, **as it will escape to the global, and exceptions will be thrown for undeclared variables in strict mode (with `useStrict` turned on).**

It is recommended that custom variables be accessed using the window/globalThis context.

## Environment Variables

Hapload.js provides the `envVariables` option to declare some virtual variables.This option is effective, but it is obviously different.

```ts{5-7}
container.registerApp({
  name: "foo",
  entry: "https://foo.com/entry",
  activeWhen: "/foo",
  envVariables: {
    __BASE__: "https://foo.com/",
  },
});
```

In a sandboxed environment, these variables can always be read in a non-sandboxed environment, accessible only in the synchronous code at the entrance.

If there is a conflict with a variable on window, the values in **envVariables** will prevail.

## Context

In sandbox, JS is executed in a separate function context, so the global variable _a_ cannot be accessed later, as in the following code:

```html
<script>
  var a = 2022;
</script>
<script>
  console.log(a);
</script>
```

If you want to share variables, you can write them on Window.
